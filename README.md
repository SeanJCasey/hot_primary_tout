Hot PRIMARY TOUT!
==============

This app is a Fieldable Panel Pane with responsive imaging.  This FPP will go 1/3 of the container.

Only thing you need after enabling this app is go to Appearance and scan your default theme for breakpoints.  

You can also check to make sure your breakpoints worked here:
admin/config/media/breakpoints

Then all you need to do is just create the FPP.  This uses entity so it will just appear in the pane selection above add text or whatever.

NOTE
===================
Make sure you upload the image in the panel pane, otherwise it ownt work

You can also put <none> in the title as well.
